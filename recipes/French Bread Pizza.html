                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

                <li>Using a serrated knife, cut the French bread in half, and then slice in half lengthwise to make 4 pizzas.

                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 4 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Remove from the oven; spread pizza sauce over each piece of bread, and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
